  The project consists in studying the different modules intended for the
creation of an application that meets the strong needs of users in terms of
supervision of the network as a whole. This application must allow users
to query the server on the different books contained in its database and to
return responses that match the provided criterion. This project will allow us
to apply the theoretical notions seen in the network TCP/IP  and to apply them to a more
convenient.

The ultimate goal is to establish a lasting connection for the duration of the request between the client and
the server. He will have to be able to provide at the start the title, the author's name, the genre and if he
contains more or less 300 pages depending on the reference transmitted by the client, in the event that
it does not exist the server sends a message informing the client and waits for a response.
Eventually the server must be able to return several different books given certain
constraints (same author, number of pages, appreciation, keywords).
